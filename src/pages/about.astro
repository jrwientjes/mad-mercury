	<h2>... and my new Astro site!</h2>

 	<p>I am working through Astro's introductory tutorial. This is the 
	second page on my website, and it's the first one I built myself!</p>

  	<p>This site will update as I complete more of the tutorial, so keep 
	checking back and see how my journey is going!</p>

	<p>Here are a few things about me:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>My name is {identity.firstName}.</li>
		<li>I live in Aztec, {identity.state} and I attend Fort Lewis College as a {identity.job}.</li>
		<li>Two of my hoddies are: {identity.hobbies[0]} and {identity.hobbies[1]}.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>My skills are:</p>
	<ul>
		{skills.map((skill) => <li class = "skill">{skill}</li>)}
	</ul>
</BaseLayout>
